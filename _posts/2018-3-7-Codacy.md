title: Codacy

I implemented [codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) so I have automatic code checking.

It is a step forward that will help so that my code won't break anything made in the past. 

I now have TravisCI, AppVeyor and Codacy automatically running after each push. The next step would be coverage, but the project is not at a stage where that would be necessary.
