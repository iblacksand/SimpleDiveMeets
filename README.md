# Simple Dive Meets

This is going to be a tool to run basic dive meets, where a very complex program isn't needed. It is not very functional at the moment.

## Features 

- [x] Dive Search
- [ ] User page where you can edit the list of dives
- [ ] import google forms results for sign-ups
- [ ] Sequential Dive Meet Runner

For now the only way to build this would be

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iblacksand/SimpleDiveMeets.git

npm install
electron .
```
